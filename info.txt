Steps to create a Cucumber BDD framework

1. Create a new Maven project and add project dependencies
   -selenium, cucumber-java, cucumber-junit, cucumber-core, faker.
1a.Add the necessary framework components (.properties file, .gitignore, utility classes )
2. Create a package structure (pages,runners, stepDefinitions, utils)
3. Create resources folder under test and add a feature file (add Cucumber Java and Gherkin plugin to IntelliJ)
4. Create a cucumber feature file (feature file represents a user story, should be named after a feature, e.g. sign-in.feature)
5. Create a Runner class that connects the feature file steps to step definitions and add the necessary configuration
6. Generate step definition methods for unimplemented steps
7. Implement each step definition method's logic
8. To run a specific scenario/s, mark the scenario with a specific tag (@temp) and then run it through the Runner class by mentioning the tag in tags option



How Cucumber Background is different from Hook?
1. Purpose: Hook is used for configuration logic whereas Background is used for test logic
2. Scope: Hook is applicable to all scenarios whereas Background is applicable only to scenarios within a single feature file


How to run scenarios with specific tag/s through CMD in Cucumber?

mvn test -D cucumber.filter.tags=@positive
mvn test -D cucumber.filter.tags="@positive and @smoke"
mvn test -D cucumber.filter.tags="@positive or @smoke"
