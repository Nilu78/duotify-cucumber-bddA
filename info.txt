Steps to create a Cucumber BDD framework

1. Create a new Maven project and add project dependencies
   -selenium, cucumber-java, cucumber-junit, cucumber-core, faker.
1a.Add the necessary framework components (.properties file, .gitignore, utility classes )
2. Create a package structure (pages,runners, stepDefinitions, utils)
3. Create resources folder under test and add a feature file (add Cucumber Java and Gherkin plugin to IntelliJ)
4. Create a cucumber feature file (feature file represents a user story, should be named after a feature, e.g. sign-in.feature)
5. Create a Runner class that connects the feature file steps to step definitions and add the necessary configuration
6. Generate step definition methods for unimplemented steps
7. Implement each step definition method's logic
8. To run a specific scenario/s, mark the scenario with a specific tag (@temp) and then run it through the Runner class by mentioning the tag in tags option
